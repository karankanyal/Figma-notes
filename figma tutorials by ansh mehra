figma from basic to advanced

figma is a company which has 2 products-
1- figma design- is a design tool where we design apps websites
2- figjam- is specially designed for to collab and share design ideas, offers more free-form canvas with features like sticky notes and drawing tool.

Raster vs Vector-
In figma design we'll create all things in Vector.
Raster is an another form of png/jpeg, It got pixelated.
But vector graphic will not get pixelated.

Canvas vs Frame-
Canvas- is the working area where we create designs by arranging elements on a virtual sheet.
Frame- is blank canvas.

Frame vs Group-
Frames have constraints while Grop does not have these
Constraints- helps us to design responsive design (if I want to change the screen size inner elements should have change it's dimension)

Alignments-
Align layer to parent
shortcut for align are left gaming buttons with alt(w-top, a-left, s-bottom, d-right, h-horizontally center, v-vertically center)
  w
a s d    v  h


Renaming is independent of how things are on canvas.
Renaming depends on the layer panel. (Means if I move order of any frame or anything in canvas it will not get changed in layer panel)
To handel this issue we use a plugin Shorter
Shorter-
Press


Text-
minimum font size- 12px
line height - (for Heading- 100%) and for (paragraphs- 135%)
letter spacing - (-2%)

Nested frame and nested constraints-
Frame inside a frame called Nested framing
And Constraints inside another constraints called nested constraints
