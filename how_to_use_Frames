Responsive design VS Adaptive design-
If we make design for a same device range then resizing it's inner fame for better UI is called Responsive design.(Frames alone helps to make Responsive design)
While making the same design for another device then we have to create whole new components and frames. It is called Adaptive design.(components helps to make Adaptive design)

Auto layout-
Auto layout is a feature by which we can arrange items in hrozontal/vertical and wrap also we can fix width/height. If width is fixed and we have selected wrap then content inside that will automatically goes to the next line or will start expending vertically.

Nested Auto layout-
Auto layout inside another autolayout is nested autolayout.
For example-
In mailbox there are multiple emails and if i delete some middle one other emails below that should jump up this can achived by auto layout. Here we need to use nested Autolayout.
